## 👋 Hello, I’m Travis Carter

I am an Assistant Professor of Criminology at the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/index.php), where I currently teach courses on research methods, statistics, and policing. 

My research centers on policing, centers on policing, with a focus on inequalities in police behavior and crime prevention, and developing evidence-based solutions through research partnerships with police agencies.
